## üîç Quick Reference

### Project Structure
```
voice-conversation-interface/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/              # Next.js pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ containers/       # Business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/       # UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/             # Utilities & hooks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/            # Documentation (you are here!)
```

### Key Technologies
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **State:** Zustand
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Voice:** Web Speech API

## üìù Contributing to Docs

### When to Update Documentation

**Update immediately when:**
- ‚úÖ Adding new major features
- ‚úÖ Changing architecture
- ‚úÖ Updating dependencies
- ‚úÖ Modifying design system
- ‚úÖ Changing deployment process

**Document in code comments when:**
- Complex algorithms
- Non-obvious solutions
- Performance optimizations
- Security considerations

### Documentation Style Guide

**Do's:**
- ‚úÖ Write in clear, simple language
- ‚úÖ Use examples and code snippets
- ‚úÖ Keep content up-to-date
- ‚úÖ Use tables for comparisons
- ‚úÖ Add emojis for visual scanning üòä

**Don'ts:**
- ‚ùå Assume knowledge
- ‚ùå Use jargon without explanation
- ‚ùå Write walls of text
- ‚ùå Leave outdated information

### Markdown Tips

```markdown
# Use headings for structure
## Subheadings for sections

Use **bold** for emphasis
Use `code` for technical terms

Create tables:
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data     | More     |

Add code blocks:
```typescript
// Your code here
```

Add links:
[Link text](./file.md)
```
